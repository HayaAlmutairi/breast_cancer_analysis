# Breast Cancer Classification using Naive Bayes
## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to developing and classifies the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset using a Naive Bayes classifier. This involves various steps, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), handling categorical variables, feature scaling using StandardScaler, training the Naive Bayes model, and evaluating its performance. The project aims to provide a hands-on experience in developing and assessing a classification model, with a specific focus on the application of Naive Bayes in a real-world scenario.
